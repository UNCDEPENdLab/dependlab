\title{Summarize Self-Report Completion for NMAP Session 2}
\usage{
summarize_nmap_s2_self_report(...)
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following columns for each participant:
- `id`: Participant ID.
- Completion metrics for each measure:
  - Number of complete items (`*_complete`).
  - Number of missing items (`*_missing`).
  - Percentage of completion (`*_percent`).
}
\description{
This function processes and summarizes self-report data for NMAP session 2. It calculates
the number of complete items, missing items, and the percentage of completion for each
psychological measure per participant. The function integrates data from Qualtrics, 
filters based on session-specific criteria, and excludes certain IDs as specified.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:
- Checks for the presence of Qualtrics API credentials.
- Fetches raw self-report and session 3 data from Qualtrics.
- Excludes specific IDs based on predefined criteria (e.g., PSU IDs).
- Calculates completion metrics (# complete, # missing, % completion) for various measures 
  such as IIP, CTQ, PANAS, PID, and others.
- Returns a cleaned dataset with summarized completion metrics per participant.
}
\note{
Ensure that Qualtrics API credentials are set in the environment using `qualtrics_api_credentials()`.
