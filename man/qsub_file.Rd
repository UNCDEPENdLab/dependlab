\title{This function submits a single script using the qsub command.
It accepts a vector PBS arguments to be passed to the scheduler and
a vector of environment variables that should be passed to the compute node at job execution.}
\usage{
qsub_file(
  script,
  pbs_args = NULL,
  env_variables = NULL,
  echo = TRUE,
  fail_on_error = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{script}{A script that should be executed by the PBS scheduler. This can contain PBS directives, but in the
case of conflicts, the directives passed with \code{pbs_args} will take precedence.}

\item{pbs_args}{A character vector of arguments to be included in the qsub command. Typically these
will begin with '-l' such as '-l walltime=10:00:00'.}

\item{env_variables}{A named character vector containing environment variables and their values to be passed
to the \code{script} at execution time using the '-v' directive. The names of this vector are the environment
variable names and the values of the vector are the environment variable values to be passed in.}

\item{echo}{Whether to echo the qsub command to the terminal at the time it is scheduled. Default: TRUE.}

\item{fail_on_error}{Whether to stop execution of the script (TRUE), or issue a warning (FALSE) if the qsub fails.
Defaults to FALSE (i.e., issue a warning).}
}
\value{
A character string containing the jobid of the scheduled job.
}
\description{
The function returns the jobid of the scheduled job.
