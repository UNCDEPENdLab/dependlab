\usage{
deconvolve_nlreg_r(
  BOLDobs,
  kernel,
  nev_lr = 0.01,
  epsilon = 0.005,
  beta = 40,
  normalize = TRUE,
  trim_kernel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{BOLDobs}{observed BOLD timeseries}

\item{kernel}{assumed kernel of the BOLD signal (e.g., from spm_hrf)}

\item{nev_lr}{learning rate for the assignment of neural events. Default: .01}

\item{epsilon}{relative error change (termination condition). Default: .005}

\item{beta}{slope of the sigmoid transfer function (higher = more nonlinear)}

\item{normalize}{whether to unit-normalize (z-score) \code{BOLDobs} before deconvolution. Default: TRUE}

\item{trim_kernel}{whether to remove the first K time points from the deconvolved vector, corresponding to
kernel leftovers from convolution. Default: TRUE}
}
\value{
A time series of the same length containing reconstructed neural events
}

This function deconvolves the BOLD signal using Bush 2011 method

The original code did not unit normalize the BOLD signal in advance, but in my testing, this
proves useful in many cases (unless you want to mess with the learning rate a lot), especially
when the time series has a non-zero mean (e.g., mean 100).
