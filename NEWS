Version 0.1-5
  - feature: add deconvolve_nlreg_resample function that implement Bush 2015 deconvolution with resampling approach
  - feature: Added runFSLCommand
  - feature: Added runAFNICommand
  - enhancement: write generate_feature_armadillo generate_feature in C++ to speed up this bottleneck in deconvolve_nlreg
  - bugfix: in evtmax_1, rescale the normalization factor for any event within the last 20 seconds using an HRF centered in the time of the run
  - enhancement: write additional_regressors if write_timing_files is not null
  - enhancement: mean center all additional regressors

Version 0.1-4
  - feature: generate_spm_mat function for generating SPM12 GLMs from build_design_matrix
  - feature: spm_extract_anatomical_rois function for extracting time series (VOIs) from SPM.mat files (for DCM)
  - bugfix:  adjust run_volumes properly when drop_volumes > 0 and run_volumes is the NIfTIs. Assume that NIfTIs already have dropped volumes

Version 0.1-1
  - feature: Added wait_for_job function to wait for qsub job.
  - feature: Added qsub_file function to submit a qsub job through R.
  - feature: Added generate_fsf_contrast_syntax function, which generates FSL Feat .fsf syntax for contrasts based on a matrix.
  - feature: Added generate_fsf_ev_syntax function, which generates FSL Feat .fsf syntax for EVs based on a design matrix.

Version 0.1
  - Initial release, mostly containing build_design_matrix, lmer_predict, and cor_with_target.
  - Later added score_ecr
