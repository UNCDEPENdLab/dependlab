}

\description{
This function fetches and processes self-report survey data from Qualtrics for 
NMAP Session 5. It calculates the number of completed, missing, and percentage
completion for various self-report measures, as well as total completion metrics
per participant.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
  \item Checks if Qualtrics API credentials are set up in the environment.
  \item Fetches survey data from Qualtrics using the specified survey ID.
  \item Cleans and organizes the data by renaming columns, converting IDs to numeric,
        removing attention check and text response fields, and selecting relevant columns.
  \item Calculates the number of completed items, missing items, and completion 
        percentages for the following measures:
        \itemize{
          \item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (90 item) (IIP-90)
          \item Personality Inventory for the DSM-5 Brief Form (PID-5-BF)
          \item Adult Self-Report (ASR)
          \item Borderline Personality Questionnaire (BPQ)
          \item Flourish Scale (FS)
          \item Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2)
          \item NIH EMOTB subscales (Emotional Support, Friend, Perceived Hostility, 
                Perceived Rejection, Perceived Stress)
          \item Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline Scale (PAI-BOR)
          \item Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN)
          \item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Alcohol Use Short Form and Severity of Substance Use Short Form (3 month)
        }
  \item Computes total completion statistics across all measures.
}
}
\note{
The function requires a valid Qualtrics API key and base URL, which must 
be set using `qualtrics_api_credentials()`. If these credentials are not configured,
the function will issue a warning and return `NULL`.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Ensure Qualtrics API credentials are set:
qualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = "your_api_key", base_url = "your_base_url")

# Fetch and summarize self-report data for NMAP Session 5
self_report_summary <- summarize_nmap_s5_self_report()
head(self_report_summary)
